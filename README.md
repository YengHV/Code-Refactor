HTML
First I commented on all the of elements that I know. 
After that,I tidy up on some things and and made it to what I think is more oraginized and spaced out; Less clustered in my opinion. 
I deleted some things that weren't nessarary.
Added alt to the img elements.

CSS
I struggled with the CSS a little bit. Since almost all of it is working already, I didn't really know what to change. I deleted some things and tried to decluster it. other than then im not too sure on what else to change.
